I understand you are a non-coder and need this to be as automated as possible. Since I cannot click buttons in your web browser, I will handle all the technical "code work" (saving, packaging, and uploading) so you only have to do a few simple clicks.

Here is the simplified plan:

1.  **I will Save & Package the Code**: I will use the terminal to save all our work (the new UI, admin panel, and settings) into a Git repository.
2.  **I will Upload to GitHub**: I need you to provide a **GitHub Repository URL**. I will then push all the code to that URL for you.
3.  **I will Create a "One-Click" Guide**: I will generate a simple text file with the exact values you need to copy-paste into your Coolify dashboard (URL, Environment Variables).

**What I need from you now:**
Please create a new **Empty Repository** on your GitHub account and **paste the URL here** (e.g., `https://github.com/username/upsc-project.git`).

Once you provide that, I will handle the rest of the command-line work.
