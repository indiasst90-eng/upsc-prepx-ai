* A real-time, interactive interview practice and evaluation studio that simulates UPSC interviews with live AI interviewer(s), real-time visual aids, and animated explanation overlays.
Core capabilities
* Live AI Interviewer: LLM-driven interviewer speaks (TTS) and asks questions; supports multi-interviewer panels.
* Real-time Visual Aids: As the candidate answers, Manim generates live diagrams, timelines, or maps that appear in the interviewer’s shared screen area to help illustrate answers (e.g., show a quick policy timeline while candidate narrates).
* Record + Instant Feedback: Session recorded (audio/video + screen overlays). After the mock, instant Revideo-generated debrief video presents: score, strengths, weaknesses, and animated corrections.
* Body Language Hints (optional): If the user consents to video upload, AI analyzes posture/smile/tone and gives improvement tips (non-invasive).
* Panel Mode & Peer Reviews: Invite mentors or peers to join sim panel; their inputs are integrated into the feedback video and transcript.
* Interview Question Bank with Difficulty Progression: Adaptive question set that increases difficulty based on performance.
User flow
1. Candidate books a slot (or instant mock).
2. System spins up an AI-panel (or live mentor) and TTS is used for the panel voice.
3. During answer, the candidate can trigger "Show Visual" button — Manim renders a quick diagram that appears in the panel (e.g., a flowchart for policy answer).
4. On completion, a Revideo debrief video is generated automatically (3–5 minutes) summarizing performance with animated highlights.

* Output: Recorded session, debrief video, annotated transcript, interview scorecard, actionable improvements.
Revideo / Manim
* Real-time: Manim microservice must be optimized for fast small renders (2–6s micro-scenes) so visuals can appear during live sessions. These micro-scenes are streamed or quickly fetched and composited by Revideo into a live overlay or recorded output.
* Post-session: Revideo compiles recorded assets, adds animated callouts (from Manim), voice commentary (TTS), and final scoring video.
Monetization
* High-value premium: per-mock fee or subscription with X mocks/month, plus paid mentor review add-on.
Privacy & Ethics
* Explicit consent for recordings and body-language analysis; secure storage and delete-on-demand.
Complexity
* Very High (requires low-latency Manim microservice, streaming compositing, real-time orchestration).
Why it’s a killer feature
* Interview prep is a huge pain point and high willingness-to-pay area. The combination of real-time visuals + immediate video debrief makes this a unique, defensible offering.

Quick implementation & priority recommendations (MVP plan)
If your goal is to start earning within 5 days, prioritize the following minimal MVP bundle:
1. RAG Search (18) — essential for accuracy. (Med)
2. 60s Topic Shorts (6) — low-cost to render; marketable. (Low–Med)
3. Notes Generator + Book-to-Notes (10 + 25) — deliver PDFs quickly. (Low–Med)
4. Real-time Doubt ? Video Converter (3) — core novelty; start with 60s videos first. (Med–High)
5. Monetisation System (28) — Stripe + subscription. (Med)
Add the Live Interview Prep Studio (34) later once the render pipeline and RAG sources are stable — it’s a revenue magnet and flagship.
