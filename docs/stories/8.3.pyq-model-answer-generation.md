## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to automatically generate model answers for extracted PYQ questions,
**so that** students can learn the expected answer format and content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Answer generation: for each extracted question, generates model answer using A4F LLM
2. RAG integration: retrieves relevant content from knowledge base to ensure factual accuracy
3. AI prompt template: "Generate a comprehensive UPSC answer for: {question}. Word limit: {limit}. Include introduction, body with examples, and conclusion."
4. Answer structure: ensures proper format - intro, main points with subheadings, examples/data, conclusion
5. Quality scoring: uses answer evaluation engine (Story 7.2) to score generated answers, regenerates if score <30/40
6. Database: stores model answers in `model_answers` table linked to question_id
7. Multiple perspectives: for complex questions, generates 2-3 model answers showing different approaches
8. Citation tracking: includes references to book chapters, committee reports, Acts used in answer
9. Review queue: admin can review and edit model answers before publishing
10. Processing time: generates answer within 15 seconds per question
