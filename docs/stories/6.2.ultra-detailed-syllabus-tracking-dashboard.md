**As a** UPSC aspirant,
**I want** a comprehensive dashboard showing completion percentage, time spent, and confidence scores for every syllabus topic,
**so that** I can track my preparation progress in detail.

## Acceptance Criteria

3. Confidence scores: per topic (0-100%), color-coded indicators
4. Heatmap calendar: daily activity visualization (like GitHub contributions)
5. Topic-level drill-down: click subject to see all topics with individual progress
