# Epic 11: Specialized Learning - Math Solver, Memory Palace & Maps

**Epic Goal:** Build specialized tools for quantitative subjects (CSAT/Economy), memory techniques (visual palace animations), and interactive geography (3D map atlas) to serve specific learning styles and subject requirements.

**Features Included:**
- FR9: Animated Math Problem Solver (step-by-step solutions, CSAT/Economy)
- FR7: Visual Memory Palace Videos (facts → animated rooms)
- FR14: 3D Interactive GS Map Atlas (geography data layers, time slider)

**Estimated Stories:** 10-12 stories covering math equation parsing, step-by-step Manim animations, memory palace templates, 3D map rendering with React Three Fiber, and historical map data integration.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Math equation parser (LaTeX, handwriting OCR)
- Manim math animation scenes
- Memory palace theming system
- GeoJSON data processing
- React Three Fiber 3D maps
