## Background Context

UPSC Civil Services preparation currently suffers from fragmentation (15+ books, 10+ websites), high costs (₹2-3 lakh coaching fees), and lack of personalization. The 5-7 lakh annual UPSC aspirants face geographic barriers (coaching concentrated in metros), static pre-recorded content that becomes outdated, and minimal individual attention in batch coaching. Existing online platforms (Unacademy, BYJU'S) offer pre-recorded lectures without real-time doubt resolution or AI-powered personalization.

UPSC AI Mentor solves this by combining three technological pillars: (1) **RAG-based knowledge system** grounding all content in standard UPSC books (Laxmikanth, NCERT, Spectrum) to prevent hallucinations, (2) **Automated video generation** using Manim (mathematical/diagram animations) and Revideo (video composition) for on-demand explainer videos, and (3) **Adaptive intelligence** tracking per-topic performance to personalize study schedules and revision packages. The platform serves all three UPSC stages—Prelims (objective), Mains (descriptive answer writing), and Interview (mock simulations)—at ₹599/month (vs ₹15,000-50,000/year for competitors), making quality preparation accessible to Tier 2/3 city aspirants and working professionals who cannot relocate for coaching.
